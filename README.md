# Evaluating Negative Sampling Approaches for Neural Topic Models

This repository contains the implementation and resources for the paper [Evaluating Negative Sampling Approaches for Neural Topic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18167) by [Suman Adhya](https://adhyasuman.github.io/), Avishek Lahiri, Debarshi Kumar Sanyal, and Partha Pratim Das, published in *IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence*, Vol. 5, No. 11, pp. 5630-5642, Nov. 2024.

## âš¡ TL;DR

This work evaluates how different **negative sampling strategies** impact **neural topic models**. By integrating negative samples into the decoder of VAE-based topic models, the authors observe improvements across **topic coherence**, **topic diversity**, and **document classification accuracy**. The study benchmarks multiple strategies across several datasets, showing that **contrastive-style training** enhances the quality and robustness of learned topicsâ€”both quantitatively and through human evaluation.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

The following publicly available datasets were used in our experiments. All datasets are preprocessed and available in the repository:

- [20NewsGroups (20NG)](https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/Eval_NegTM/tree/master/preprocessed_datasets/20NewsGroup) â€” A collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned across 20 different newsgroups.
- [GoogleNews (GN)](https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/Eval_NegTM/tree/master/preprocessed_datasets/GN) â€” News headlines and content extracted from Google News, curated for topic modeling tasks.
- [M10](https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/Eval_NegTM/tree/master/preprocessed_datasets/M10) â€” A scholarly dataset containing abstracts of scientific publications across 10 disciplines.
- [Wiki40B](https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/Eval_NegTM/tree/master/preprocessed_datasets/Wiki40B) â€” A **subsample** of the [original Wiki40B dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/wiki40b) consisting subset of 24,774 English documents.
