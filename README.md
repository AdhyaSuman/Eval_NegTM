# Evaluating Negative Sampling Approaches for Neural Topic Models

This repository contains the implementation and resources for the paper [Evaluating Negative Sampling Approaches for Neural Topic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18167) by [Suman Adhya](https://adhyasuman.github.io/), Avishek Lahiri, Debarshi Kumar Sanyal, and Partha Pratim Das, published in *IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence*, Vol. 5, No. 11, pp. 5630-5642, Nov. 2024.

## âš¡ TL;DR

This work evaluates how different **negative sampling strategies** impact **neural topic models**. By integrating negative samples into the decoder of VAE-based topic models, the authors observe improvements across **topic coherence**, **topic diversity**, and **document classification accuracy**. The study benchmarks multiple strategies across several datasets, showing that **contrastive-style training** enhances the quality and robustness of learned topicsâ€”both quantitatively and through human evaluation.


## ðŸ“Š Datasets

The following publicly available datasets were used in our experiments. All datasets are preprocessed and available in this repository:

- [**20NewsGroups (20NG)**](https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/Eval_NegTM/tree/master/preprocessed_datasets/20NewsGroup) â€” A collection of approximately **16,309 documents** (after preprocessing), distributed across 20 different newsgroups. Detailed preprocessing steps are available in the [metadata file](https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/Eval_NegTM/blob/master/preprocessed_datasets/20NewsGroup/metadata.json).

- [**GoogleNews (GN)**](https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/Eval_NegTM/tree/master/preprocessed_datasets/GN) â€” A dataset comprising **11,109 news articles**, titles, and snippets, collected from the Google News website in **November 2013**.

- [**M10**](https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/Eval_NegTM/tree/master/preprocessed_datasets/M10) â€” A scholarly corpus from **CiteSeerX**, consisting of **8,355 scientific abstracts** across **10 research domains**.

- [**Wiki40B**](https://github.com/AdhyaSuman/Eval_NegTM/tree/master/preprocessed_datasets/Wiki40B) â€” A **subsample** of the [original Wiki40B dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/wiki40b), containing **24,774 English Wikipedia articles**. This subset was selected to balance quality and computational feasibility.
